(maybe) billion children doing character recognition

Scractch Implementation of neural network with Calculation exposed Calucationto crowd sourced as a part intuition building

0.0) nXn grid (3X3 grid) giving the data and very small nn on it.

0.1) [Base] using nn digit prediction, do digit prediction.
0.5) extend to alphabet
0.6) Devanagari script (tangent maybe)

0.2) create a ‘playable’(writable) for testing

1.0) convert the calculation in the model prediction into children homework (~5th class student or toddler) {on 0.0 and 0.1} 
1.1) publishing it to website, where children can add up to help training giving on hand work to be connected to new thing.
1.1) training of model calculation (browny points)
